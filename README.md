# harbor
harbor is an automated service orchestration system built on top of Docker (for containerization), Fleet (for cluster deployment), and Consul (for service discovery and health checks). It is designed to be used in a CoreOS cluster, but can be used in any cluster that has Docker and Fleet installed.
